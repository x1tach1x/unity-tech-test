This is a simple game of Fetch to demonstrate optimal path finding. The algorithm is set up to work with a grid without hard coding in the grid size.
It also generates the grid nodes as they are needed.

I was inspired to create this simple proof of concept by my dog who Kept laying under my feet during the development. 
The game itself is not the most flashy or awesome but it could be used as part of something like a minigame for a pet sim for the player to build chemestry or stats for their pet. By improving the enviornment, models,
add sound effects and animations etc the project could turn into something with potential. It can also be used as part of as battle system
for characters who have pets etc.
